# Orbit - Task Management & Productivity

Orbit is a gamified task management application designed to make productivity engaging and visually immersive. By abstracting tasks into celestial bodies, Orbit transforms your daily to-do list into a thriving solar system, where completing tasks contributes to the growth and harmony of your personal universe.

## Core Features

### 1. Gamified Task Visualization
Tasks are represented as planets, comets, or satellites within a dynamic solar system.
*   **Planets**: Standard tasks that orbit a central sun.
*   **Satellites**: specialized tasks with distinct visual cues.
*   **Comets**: Tasks with unique trajectories and visual flair.
*   **Moons**: Subtasks orbit their parent tasks (planets), creating a nested hierarchy of goals.

### 2. Immersive Universe View
Expanding beyond a single list, the "Known Universe" view allows you to manage multiple categories of tasks as distinct solar systems. The universe orbits a central void, providing a macro-level perspective of your productivity across different life domains (e.g., Work, Personal, Health).

### 3. Interactive System Management
*   **System Inspector**: Tap on any solar system in the universe view to inspect its contents.
*   **Renaming**: Directly rename task categories (solar systems) from within the inspector interface.
*   **Destruction**: Destroying a system plays a dramatic animation where the system is sucked into the central void, symbolizing the clearing or abandonment of an accumulated project.
*   **Rearrangement**: Solar systems dynamically reorder themselves in orbit when one is removed.
*   **Creation**: Easily establish new solar systems to categorize fresh sets of tasks.

### 4. Dynamic Animations & Visuals
*   **Living Environment**: The application features a constantly animating environment with orbiting bodies, agitating suns based on deadlines, and background star fields.
*   **Cutscenes**: High-quality visual sequences reward user actions:
    *   **Launch**: initiating a new task triggers a rocket launch or planet formation sequence.
    *   **Completion**: Finishing a task triggers a satisfying mission complete animation.
    *   **Destruction**: Deleting tasks or systems initiates explosive or implosive visual effects.
*   **Haptic Feedback**: Meaningful haptic vibrations accompany interactions, adding tactile weight to your productivity actions.

### 5. Detailed Task Management
*   **Deadlines & Agitation**: As deadlines approach, the visual environment reacts (e.g., the sun becomes more agitated), providing intuitive urgency cues.
*   **Subtasks**: Break down larger missions into smaller, manageable subtasks (moons).
*   **Collision Progress**: Visualize progress through "collision" mechanics where completing subtasks contributes to the main task's mass or status.
*   **Recurring Tasks**: Support for monthly and yearly recurring missions.
*   **Scheduling**: Integrated custom calendar and time picker for precise deadline setting.

### 6. Minimalist & Sci-Fi Aesthetic
The interface uses a dark, high-contrast palette with sleek typography and neon accents, drawing inspiration from sci-fi interfaces to keep the user focused and immersed. The controls can be minimized to enjoy the view of your productive output.
